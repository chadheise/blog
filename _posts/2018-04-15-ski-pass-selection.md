As a snowboarder and recent skier I enjoy hitting the slopes every year. Unfortunately, lift ticket prices can add up so it is useful to do some planning to get a good deal. There are a few different multi-resort ski packages but it can be difficult to find the right one based on where and how often you plan to ski. I took some of the most popular ski passes and mapped out each of their resorts on a single map so you can easily compare the options.

- [EDGE card](https://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/plan-your-trip/lift-access/edge-cards.aspx) - multi-day passes at [Whistler Blackcomb](https://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/) for Washington State & Candadian residents
- [Epic Pass](https://www.epicpass.com/) - unlimited & multi-day passes at Vail owned resorts
- [Ikon Pass](http://www.ikonpass.com) - unlimited passes at a collection of resorts
- [Mountain Collective](https://mountaincollective.com/) - ski 2 days at each of 16 ski resorts
- [Max Pass](http://www.themaxpass.com/) - ski 5 days at each of 44 ski resorts (No longer offered - replaced by Ikon Pass)
